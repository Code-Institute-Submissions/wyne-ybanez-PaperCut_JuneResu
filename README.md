## User Experience Design

### **The Strategy Plane**

The user doesn't know what book they would like to read. Perhaps they know the genre they might like to read but 
they woudln't know exactly where to start. Alternatively, they might have just read a fantastic book and would like 
to share their opinions. Papercut is the site that will allow them to engage with other readers and 
share their personal reviews. 

This website aims to allow the reader to quickly find book recommendations and create reviews on books they have 
read, reviews which can be seen by other users to help them make a decision on whether to read/purchase a certain 
book. All reviews are recorded and can be editted or deleted by their respective authors. The users can also add relavant 
information such as author names and links to cover page. There will be a voting feature so users can upvote their liked 
books.

#### Site Goals

* To bring together like-minded readers and allow them to express their views on a novel they enjoy or dislike.
* To help readers make a decision on what book they should read next.
* The website could conceivably look to earn income through affiliate links for these book.

#### User stories

* As a user, I immediately want to know the purpose as to why the site was made.
* As a user, I would like if the website were easy to navigate and that I never felt lost no matter where I was 
when exploring the website
* As a user, I want the website to me responsive, if I were to view it on mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop. I expect
it's content to be clear and be position accordingly.
* As a user, I want to be able to register an account to the website so I can post comments or create reviews.
* As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete the reviews/comments I post.
* As a user, I want to be able to search or filter books on a custom genre or criteria as best suits me.
* As a user, I want to be able to contact the site's owner so I can provide feedback on the website.
